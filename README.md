Data Cleaning/Review
Review legacy files and identify relationships to be created, and constraints to be put in place to manage data.

Data Modeling
Migrate legacy files into a database and create a table schema to properly host data using a Postgre SQL database. Then use Quick DBD web tool to create a diagram to visually present the schema of the DB for steakholder consumption. Lastly, write a script that creates all necessary tables outlined in the table schema design.

Data Analysis
Translate the questions of steakholders into Actionable queries that could be used to draw insights.

Data Engineering
Create a connection using python's sqlalchemy library to access new database.
